# Password Manager 

This is a basic Password manager with built-in password generator that allows a user to safely secure their passwords with the help of cryptographic methods.. All the data is stored in MySQL database.

I have used the rich module as well to make an intuitive and interesting terminal based UI.

Additionally, Iâ€™ve made use of SHA512 hashing algorithm for safely hashing the master password and PBKDF2 to derive a cryptographic key that will be used in encryption and decryption of the passwords.

## Modules used:
    - Rich
    - Secrets (available in python std library)
    - PyCrypto
    - mysql-connector-python
