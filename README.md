# Password Manager 

- This is a basic Password manager with built-in password generator that allows a user to safely secure their passwords with the help of cryptographic methods. All the data is stored in MySQL database.

- I have used the rich module as well to make an intuitive and interesting terminal based UI.

- Additionally, Iâ€™ve made use of **SHA256** hashing algorithm for safely hashing the master password and PBKDF2 (making use of SHA512) to derive a cryptographic key that will be used in encryption and decryption of the passwords.
Encryption carried out using **AES256**.

(Will add more relevant info later)
