# Password Manager 

- This is a basic Password manager with built-in password generator that allows a user to safely secure their passwords with the help of cryptographic methods.. All the data is stored in MySQL database.

- I have used the rich module as well to make an intuitive and interesting terminal based UI.

- Additionally, Iâ€™ve made use of **SHA512** hashing algorithm for safely hashing the master password and PBKDF2 to derive a cryptographic key that will be used in encryption and decryption of the passwords.
Encryption carried out using **AES256**.

## Modules used:
   ### 3rd party 
    - Rich
    - PyCrypto
    - mysql-connector-python
    - Pycryptodome
    
   ### Built-in 
    - getpass
    - base64
    - strings
    - secrets
